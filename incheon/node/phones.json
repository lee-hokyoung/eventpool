While in his quarters, and ignoring her protests, he raped her.

His mother was Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. He was married to Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. Amon began his reign at the age of 22, and reigned for two years. (2 Kings 21:18-19 ) William F. Albright has dated his reign to 642-640 BC, while E. R. Thiele offers the dates 643/642 – 641/640 BC.[1] Amon continued his father's practice of idolatry, and set up the images as his father had done.Zephaniah 1:4 (also 3:4 , and 11) describes his reign as marked by moral depravity. He was assassinated (2 Kings 21:18-26 , 2 Chronicles 33:20- 25 ) by his servants, who conspired against him, and was succeeded by his son Josiah, who was eight years old. (2 Kings 22:1 ) At the end of Amon's reign, the international situation was in flux: to the east, the Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate, the Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it, and Egypt to the west was still recovering from Assyrian rule. In this power vacuum, Jerusalem was able to govern itself without foreign intervention. He is also one of the kings mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew. Thiele's dates for Amon are tied to the dates for his son Josiah, who reigned 31 years (2 Kings 22:1). Josiah's death at the hands of Pharaoh Necho II occurred in the summer of 609 BC.[2] By Judean reckoning that began regnal years in the fall month of Tishri, this would be in the year 610/609 BC.

Name. 1. Various Forms: In the Old Testament, when applied, to the patriarch, the name appears as 'abhram, up to Gen 17:5; thereafter always as 'abhraham. Two other persons are named 'abhiram. The identity of this name with 'abhram cannot be doubted in view of the variation between 'abhiner and 'abhner, 'abhishalom and 'abhshalom, etc. Abraham also appears in the list at Karnak of places conquered by Sheshonk I: 'brm (no. 72) represents 'abram, with which Spiegelberg (Aegypt. Randglossen zum Altes Testament, 14) proposes to connect the preceding name (so that the whole would read \"the field of Abram.\" Outside of Israel this name (Abiramu) has come to light just where from the Biblical tradition we should expect to find it, namely, in Babylonia (e.g. in a contract of the reign of Apil-Sin, second predecessor of Hammurabi; also for the aunt (!) of Esarhaddon 680-669 BC). Ungnad has recently found it, among documents from Dilbat dating from the Hammurabi dynasty, in the forms A-ba-am-ra-ma, A-ba-am- ra-am, as well as A-ba-ra-ma. 2. Etymology: Until this latest discovery of the apparently full, historical form of the Babylonian equivalent, the best that could be done with the etymology was to make the first constituent \"father of\" (construct -i rather than suffix - i), and the second constituent \"Ram,\" a proper name or an abbreviation of a name. (Yet observe above its use in Assyria for a woman; compare ABISHAG; ABIGAIL). Some were inclined rather to concede that the second element was a mystery, like the second element in the majority of names beginning with 'abh and 'ach, \"father\" and \"brother.\" But the full cuneiform writing of the name, with the case-ending am, indicates that the noun \"father\" is in the accusative, governed by the verb which furnishes the second component, and that this verb therefore is probably ramu (= Hebrew racham) \"to love,\" etc.; so that the name would mean something like \"he loves the (his) father.\" (So Ungnad, also Ranke in Gressmann's article \"Sage und Geschichte in den Patriarchenerzahlungen,\" ZATW (1910), 3.) Analogy proves that this is in the Babylonian fashion of the period, and that judging from the various writings of this and similar names, its pronunciation was not far from

His flocks were often fed in the pastures of Shechem as well as Dothan. Of all the children in his household, he loved Rachel’s firstborn son, Joseph, the most. Thus Joseph’s half brothers were jealous of him and they ridiculed him often. Joseph even told his father about all of his half brothers’ misdeeds. When Joseph was seventeen years old, Jacob made a long coat or tunic of many colors for him. Seeing this, the half brothers began to hate Joseph. Then Joseph began to have dreams that implied that his family would bow down to him. When he told his brothers about these dreams, it drove them to conspire against him. When Jacob heard of these dreams, he rebuked his son for proposing the idea that the house of Jacob would even bow down to Joseph. Yet, he contemplated his son’s words about these dreams. (Genesis 37:1-11)\r\n\r\nSometime afterward, the sons of Jacob by Leah, Bilhah and Zilpah, were feeding his flocks in Shechem. Jacob wanted to know how things were doing, so he asked Joseph to go down there and return with a report. This was the last time he would ever see his son in Hebron. Later that day, the report that Jacob ended up receiving came from Joseph's brothers who brought before him a coat laden with blood. Jacob identified the coat as the one he made for Joseph. At that moment he cried “It is my son’s tunic. A wild beast has devoured him. Without doubt Joseph is torn to pieces.” He rent his clothes and put sackcloth around his waist mourning for days. No one from the house of Jacob could comfort him during this time of bereavement. (Genesis 37:31-35)\r\nThe truth was, Jacob’s son Joseph, was turned on by his brothers and ultimately sold into slavery on a caravan headed for Egypt.

Jonah is furious, however, and angrily tells God that this is the reason he tried to flee from Him, as he knew Him to be a just and merciful God. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. Initially grateful, Jonah's anger returns the next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, withering it, and he tells God that it would be better if he were dead. God then points out: \"Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night. And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?\"\r\nIronically, the relentless God demonstrated in the first chapter becomes the merciful God in the last two chapters (see 3:10). In a parallel turnabout, Jonah becomes one of the most effective of all prophets, turning the entire population of Nineveh (about 120,000 people) to God."},{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Big fish which swallows Jonas "}],"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Story of Jonah"}},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Museum_Gemaldegalerie","@type":"http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Item","http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/own":{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Jacob_struggles_with_the_angel"}},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Rhesa","@type":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Person","http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/gender":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"male"},"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/hasChildren":{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Joanan"},"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/hasParents":{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Zerubbabel_Son_of_Shealtiel"},"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/relatedVerses":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Luke 3:27 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,"},"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description":[{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Luke 3:27\r\nthe son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,"},{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":" 예수의 조상중 한 사람으로 스룹바벨의 아들이며 요아난의 아비로서 르바야와 동일인물인 듯하다(눅 3:27).

Afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry. Then the LORD said to Moses, \"Go down, because your people, whom you brought up out of Egypt, have become corrupt. They have been quick to turn away from what I commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf. They have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.' \"I have seen these people,\" the LORD said to Moses, \"and they are a stiff-necked people. Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.\" But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. \"O LORD,\" he said, \"why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? Why should the Egyptians say, 'It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth'? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people. Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.'\" Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened. Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back. The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God, engraved on the tablets. When Joshua heard the noise of the people shouting, he said to Moses, \"There is the sound of war in the camp.\" Moses replied: \"It is not the sound of victory, it is not the sound of defeat; it is the sound of singing that I hear.\" When Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands, breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain. And he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire; then he ground it to powder, scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it. He said to Aaron, \"What did these people do to you, that you led them into such great sin?\" \"Do not be angry, my lord,\" Aaron answered. \"You know how prone these people are to evil. They said to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. As for this fellow Moses who brought us up out of Egypt, we don't know what has happened to him.' So I told them, 'Whoever has any gold jewelry, take it off.' Then they gave me the gold, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!\" Moses saw that the people were running wild and that Aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies. So he stood at the entrance to the camp and said, \"Whoever is for the LORD, come to me.\" And all the Levites rallied to him. Then he said to them, \"This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: 'Each man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor.'\" The Levites did as Moses commanded, and that day about three thousand of the people died. Then Moses said, \"You have been set apart to the LORD today, for you were against your own sons and brothers, and he has blessed you this day.\" The next day Moses said to the people, \"You have committed a great sin. But now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.\" So Moses went back to the LORD and said, \"Oh, what a great sin these people have committed! They have made themselves gods of gold. But now, please forgive their sin--but if not, then blot me out of the book you have written.\" The LORD replied to Moses, \"Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book. Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish them for their sin.\" And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf Aaron had made.\n"},"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"In Hebrew, the incident is known  \"The Sin of the Calf\".

The sacred historians may have dropped the first part of the name in consequence of the character of the king. 2. The Accession: Ahaz was the son of Jotham, king of Judah. He succeeded to the throne at the age of 20 years (according to another reading 25). The chronology of his reign is difficult, as his son Hezekiah is stated to have been 25 years of age when he began to reign 16 years after (2 Ki 18:2). If the accession of Ahaz be placed as early as 743 BC, his grandfather Uzziah, long unable to perform the functions of his office on account of his leprosy (2 Ch 26:21), must still have been alive. (Others date Ahaz later, when Uzziah, for whom Jotham had acted as regent, was already dead.) 3. Early Idolatries: Although so young, Ahaz seems at once to have struck out an independent course wholly opposed to the religious traditions of his nation. His first steps in this direction were the causing to be made and circulated of molten images of the Baalim, and the revival in the valley of Hinnom, south of the city, of the abominations of the worship of Moloch (2 Ch 28:2,3). He is declared to have made his own son \"pass through the fire\" (2 Ki 16:3); the chronicler puts it even more strongly: he \"burnt his children in the fire\" (2 Ch 28:3).

A few people in the Bible have this name: (1.) The son of Phinehas, grandson of Eli, and brother of Ichabod.

This Ahitub may have been high priest in the later time of the kings, but he also may not have been a high priest.

The natural meaning is not forty years after the last-mentioned preceding date, but at the close of the fortieth calendar year of the reign of David.

His Reign: Ahaziah became king over Israel in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and he reigned two years, 854- 853 BC. There is, here an incongruity between the synchronism and the length of the reigns of the kings. Jehoshaphat began to reign in the fourth year of Ahab (1 Ki 22:41), and he reigned 22 years (1 Ki 16:29). Accordingly Ahaziah's first year, in the twenty-second year of Ahab, would fall in the nineteenth year of Jehoshaphat. The chronological statement in 2 Ki 1:17 is probably taken from the Syriac, and both are in harmony wrath a method of computation followed by certain Greek manuscripts. 2. His Character: A good name does not insure a good character.

Then David said to Saul, \"Who am I? And what is my life or my father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?\" David was confused because he came from a lowly family and the king wanted him to marry his daughter.\r\n\r\nWhen it came time for the wedding, Saul's daughter was given to another man to marry. I wonder if David felt sad. Saul had another daughter named Michal who loved David. They told Saul and it pleased Saul that they should marry--Saul said in his heart, \" I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.\" Saul knew that his daughter would be trouble to David so he said, \"Thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain.\"\r\n\r\nSaul commanded his servants, \"Commune with David secretly and tell him, 'Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in law.'\" And so, the king servants spoke these words in the ears of David. David answered and said, \"Does it seem insignificant to you to be a king's son-in-law considering that I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?\"\r\n\r\nThen Saul's servants went back and told Saul what David said. Then Saul said, \"Thus shall ye say to David, 'The king does not want a dowry (a gift for his daughter) but rather 100 foreskins of his enemies the Philistines.'\" King Saul didn't really want the foreskins, he wanted David to get killed while fighting the Philistines. After the servants told David what the King said, David was pleased to be the king's son-in-law. So David and his men went and killed 200 Philistines and David brought their foreskins to the King. Saul's plan didn't work. God help David to slay the king's enemies. Saul then gave David his daughter Michal to wife. Saul grew more afraid of David because he could see that the hand of the Lord was with David. He also saw that his daughter Michal loved David. This made Saul more and more jealous and he became more of an enemy to David.

No one went out and no one came in. Then the LORD said to Joshua, \"See, I have delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men. March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days. Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams' horns in front of the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the priests blowing the trumpets. When you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets, have all the people give a loud shout; then the wall of the city will collapse and the people will go up, every man straight in.\" So Joshua son of Nun called the priests and said to them, \"Take up the ark of the covenant of the LORD and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it.\" And he ordered the people, \"Advance! March around the city, with the armed guard going ahead of the ark of the LORD.\" When Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the LORD went forward, blowing their trumpets, and the ark of the LORD'S covenant followed them. The armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard followed the ark. All this time the trumpets were sounding. But Joshua had commanded the people, \"Do not give a war cry, do not raise your voices, do not say a word until the day I tell you to shout. Then shout!\" So he had the ark of the LORD carried around the city, circling it once. Then the people returned to camp and spent the night there. Joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward, marching before the ark of the LORD and blowing the trumpets. The armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets kept sounding. So on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days. On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven times. The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet blast, Joshua commanded the people, \"Shout! For the LORD has given you the city! The city and all that is in it are to be devoted to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared, because she hid the spies we sent. But keep away from the devoted things, so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them. Otherwise you will make the camp of Israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it. All the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the LORD and must go into his treasury.\" When the trumpets sounded, the people shouted, and at the sound of the trumpet, when the people gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so every man charged straight in, and they took the city. They devoted the city to the LORD and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it--men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys. Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, \"Go into the prostitute's house and bring her out and all who belong to her, in accordance with your oath to her.\" So the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out Rahab, her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her. They brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of Israel. Then they burned the whole city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the LORD'S house.

The first Adam brought sin into the world. \"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned\" (Rom. 5:12). On the other hand, the last Adam, Christ, brought us out of the world. \"For if by one man’s offense death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ\" (Rom. 5:17)."},{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Adam in Smiths Bible Dictionary (red earth), the name given in Scripture to the first man. It apparently has reference to the ground from which he was formed, which is called in Hebrew Adamah. The idea of redness of color seems to be inherent in either word. The creation of man was the work of the sixth day--the last and crowning act of creation. Adam was created (not born) a perfect man in body and spirit, but as innocent and completely inexperienced as a child. The man Adam was placed in a garden which the Lord God had planted \"eastward in Eden,\" for the purpose of dressing it and keeping it. [EDEN] Adam was permitted to eat of the fruit of every tree in the garden but one, which was called (\"the tree of the knowledge of good and evil,\" because it was the test of Adam's obedience. By it Adam could know good and evil int he divine way, through obedience; thus knowing good by experience in resisting temptation and forming a strong and holy character, while he knew evil only by observation and inference. Or he could \"know good and evil,\" in Satan's way, be experiencing the evil and knowing good only by contrast. -ED.) The prohibition to taste the fruit of this tree was enforced by the menace of death. There was also another tree which was called \"the tree of life.\" While Adam was in the garden of Eden, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air were brought to him to be named. After this the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, and took one of his ribs from him, which he fashioned into a woman and brought her to the man. At this time they were both described as being naked without the consciousness of shame. By the subtlety of the serpent the woman who was given to be with Adam was beguiled into a violation of the one command which had been imposed upon them. She took of the fruit of the forbidden tree and gave it to her husband. The propriety of its name was immediately shown in the results which followed; self-consciousness was the first-fruits of sin their eyes were opened and they knew that they were naked. Though the curse of Adam's rebellion of necessity fell upon him, yet the very prohibition to eat of the tree of life after his transgression was probably a manifestation of divine mercy, because the greatest malediction of all would have been to have the gift of indestructible life super- added to a state of wretchedness and sin. The divine mercy was also shown in the promise of a deliverer given at the very promise of a deliverer given at the very time the curse was imposed, Ge 3:15 and opening a door of hope to Paradise, regained for him and his descendants.

Hear, O Israel, and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, promised you. Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one. Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength. These commandments that I give you today are to be upon your hearts. Impress them on your children. Talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. Tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. Write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates. When the LORD your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you--a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant--then when you eat and are satisfied, be careful that you do not forget the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. Fear the LORD your God, serve him only and take your oaths in his name. Do not follow other gods, the gods of the peoples around you; for the LORD your God, who is among you, is a jealous God and his anger will burn against you, and he will destroy you from the face of the land. Do not test the LORD your God as you did at Massah. Be sure to keep the commands of the LORD your God and the stipulations and decrees he has given you. Do what is right and good in the LORD'S sight, so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land that the LORD promised on oath to your forefathers, thrusting out all your enemies before you, as the LORD said. In the future, when your son asks you, \"What is the meaning of the stipulations, decrees and laws the LORD our God has commanded you?\" tell him: \"We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. Before our eyes the LORD sent miraculous signs and wonders--great and terrible--upon Egypt and Pharaoh and his whole household. But he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land that he promised on oath to our forefathers. The LORD commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the LORD our God, so that we might always prosper and be kept alive, as is the case today. And if we are careful to obey all this law before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us, that will be our righteousness.\""},"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"shema"}},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Sinites","@type":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Person","http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/gender":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"male"},"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/hasParents":{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Canaan"},"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/hasSiblings":[{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Hivites"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Girgashites"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Hamathites"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Arkites"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Jebusites"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Hittites"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Amorites"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Arvadites"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Zemarites"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Sidon"}],"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/relatedVerses":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Genesis 10:15~19  Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites, Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,Arvadites, Zemarites and Hamathites.

Naboth, however, had inherited his land from his father, and, according to Jewish law, could not alienate it. Accordingly, he refused to sell it to the king.\r\nAhab became deeply dejected, at not being able to procure the vineyard. Returning to his palace, he collapsed with depression, lying on his bed, his face to the wall, and refused to eat. His wife, Jezebel, after learning the reason for his depression, (in addition to being irritated at the king's emotional state urging him to return to his entertainment saying mockingly, \"Are you the king or aren't you?\") promised that she would obtain the vineyard for him. To do so, she plotted to kill Naboth by mock trial, and then told Ahab to take possession of the vineyard as the legal heir.\r\nAs punishment for this action, the prophet Elijah visited Ahab while he was in the vineyard, pronouncing doom on him.

Both academic views and traditional thought hence view the narrative of the judges as ending at Samson, picking up again at 1 Samuel 1:1 to consider Eli, and continuing through to 1 Samuel 7:2.

Esau ended up selling his birthright to Jacob in exchange for some bread and lentil stew. Then, when old, blind Isaac called for Esau to pass on to him his blessings before he dies, Jacob, through the prodding of Rebekah, beats Esau to the blessing by pretending to be Esau and tricking his father, Isaac (Genesis 27:1-40). How remorseful and bitter Esau was for having lost to Jacob his birthright and his father's blessings, too.\r\n\r\nEsau was so angry at Jacob that he promised to kill his brother after his father dies. Rebekah knew about it and told Jacob to flee with Isaac's consent causing them (mother and son and brothers) to be separated from each other for a long, long time.

After the casting of lots upon these animals, one was sacrificed as a “sin-offering” and the other was “set alive before Jehovah” (Leviticus 16:9, 10).\nThe blood of the slain goat was taken into the most holy place where it was sprinkled upon the mercy seat. This, of course, was typical of the sacrificial death of Christ (Hebrews 9:11, 12). The high priest then took the living goat, laid hands upon him and confessed over him all the iniquities of the people. Subsequently, by an appointed servant, the animal was led away into the wilderness (Leviticus 16:21, 22).The two goats were, so to speak, two sides of the same coin; both constituted the solitary offering of Christ. The one signified his death and the atoning effect of his blood, the other his resurrection (cf. Romans 4:25) and the complete removal of our sins (cf.

Genesis 15:18-21 describes a part of the Abrahamic Covenant, specifically dealing with the dimensions of the land God promised to Abraham and his descendants."}},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Thomas_Fisher_Rare_Book_Library","@type":"http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Item","http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/own":{"@id":"http://bibleontology.com/resource/work:0004"}},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Stadel_Museum","@type":"http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Item","http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/own":{"@id":"http://bibleontology.com/resource/work:0025"}},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Shobi","@type":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Person","http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description":[{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":" 암몬 족속에 속한 랍바 사람 나하스의 아들. 압살롬의 반역으로 마하나임으로 피신한 다윗과 백성들에게 양식을 공급했다(삼하 17:27-29).

This very exact rendering makes it evident even to an English reader that the text is imperfect. Ginsburg offers a corrected form taken substantially from the parallel passage in 1 Ch 11:11: \"Jashobeam a son of a Hachmonite, chief of the captains; he lifted up his spear.\" This is plausible, and is very generally accepted, and eliminates the names Adino and Eznite, which do not occur elsewhere in the Bible. Some of the facts are against this. The Septuagint has the names Adino and Eznite. The Latin finds no proper names in the passage, but so translates the words as to presuppose the Hebrew text as we have it. It may be a case for suspended judgment. The texts concerning David's mighty men are fragmentary both in Samuel and in Chronicles.

The word is always treated as a common noun in the ordinary Greek copies, being rendered either \"brother\" or \"brothers,\" or \"his brother\" or \"his brothers\"; but this is probably to be taken as an instance of the relative inferiority of the Greek text as compared with the Massoretic Text. See OSTRACA. (1) One of the sons of Beriah, the son of Elpaal, the son of Shaharaim and Hushim, reckoned among the families of Benjamin (1 Ch 8:14).

It is among the Dutch master's final works, likely completed within two years of his death in 1669. Depicting the moment of the prodigal son's return to his father in the Biblical parable, it is a renowned work described by art historian Kenneth Clark as \"a picture which those who have seen the original in Leningrad may be forgiven for claiming as the greatest picture ever painted\".\r\nIn the painting, the son has returned home in a wretched state from travels in which he wasted his inheritance and fell into poverty and despair. He kneels before his father in repentance, wishing for forgiveness and a renewed place in the family, having realized that even his father's servants had a better station in life than he. His father receives him with a tender gesture. His hands seem to suggest mothering and fathering at once; the left appears larger and more masculine, set on the son's shoulder, while the right is softer and more receptive in gesture.[3] Standing at the right is the prodigal son's older brother, who crosses his hands in judgment; in the parable he objects to the father's compassion for the sinful son:"},{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"But he answered his father, \"Behold, these many years I have served you, and I never disobeyed a commandment of yours, but you never gave me a goat, that I might celebrate with my friends.

He was lost, and is found\" (Luke 15:32).\r\nRembrandt was moved by the parable, and he made a variety of drawings, etchings, and paintings on the theme that spanned decades, beginning with a 1636 etching (see Gallery). The Return of the Prodigal Son includes figures not directly related to the parable but seen in some of these earlier works; their identities have been debated. The woman at top left, barely visible, is likely the mother,[4] while the seated man, whose dress implies wealth, may be an advisor to the estate or a tax collector.

In response, Boaz invites her to eat with him and his workers regularly as well as deliberately leaving grain for her to claim while keeping a protective eye on her. It should be noted that the tradition of Boaz descending from a Canaanite prostitute stems from confusion regarding the identity of the mother of Boaz, who is not mentioned in the Tanakh but is in the Genealogical record of Matthew; Because they have the same name some people believe she is the same person mentioned in Joshua, but that is not supported by linguistic and textual evidence.\r\nBoaz married Ruth and, consequently, preserved the name of Elimelech, Naomi's deceased husband, a sort of levirate. Their firstborn was considered a son of Elimelech's lineage (Rt-4.5, 10). Boaz purchased the family lands that Naomi had sold, and restituted them to Elimelech's lineage (vv. 3, 7–10). For those substituting, redeeming factors, Ruth's husband is considered by Christians to be a type of Jesus of Nazareth, whom they consider to be the Messiah.\r\nAlthough Boaz is noted to be much older than Ruth in the traditional account[13] and he marries her for Naomi's sake, most dramatic adaptations[citation needed] have Boaz as a handsome young man so as to enhance the romantic nature of the story.\r\nTheir son was Obed, father of Jesse, and grandfather of David. Boaz is mentioned in both the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke as an ancestor of Jesus, \"according to the flesh\"."},"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Meeting of Lot and Boas"}},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Peace","@type":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Subject","http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/relatedVerses":[{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Luke 2:14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!"},{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Romans 12:18 As much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men."},{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"John 14:27 Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you.

Using her powers of seduction and deception, Delilah persistently wore down Samson with her repeated requests, until he finally divulged the crucial information. Having taken the Nazirite vow at birth, Samson had been set apart to God. As part of that vow, his hair was never to be cut. When Samson told Delilah that his strength would leave him if a razor were to be used on his head, she cunningly crafted her plan with the Philistine rulers. While Samson slept on her lap, Delilah called in a co-conspirator to shave off the seven braids of his hair. Subdued and weak, Samson was captured. As he slaved at grinding grain, his hair began to grow, but the careless Philistines paid no attention.

In the last lines of this inscription, carved on a stela set up to commemorate Merenptah's victory over the Libyans in his fifth year on the throne (about 1209 or 1208 BC), the king boasts of his victories over various peoples and places in Syria-Palestine. Here, he claims, with the common exaggeration of royal inscriptions, that \"Israel is desolate, and has no seed\".\r\n \r\nClearly, Merenptah's army had victoriously fought some part of Israel, and the message to us today is clear. By this point in history, the Israelites were in the land of Canaan though the account does not really help us to date their actual arrival. Hence, the majority view among scholars is that the Exodus must have taken place by at least the 13th Century BC.\r\n \r\nMoses, of course, plays an obviously important role in the Exodus. The Bible tells us that he was born in Egypt to slave parents and saved from a genocidal policy of the pharaoh when his mother places him adrift on the Nile in a basket. The basket was then found by a daughter of the king, and he was thus brought up at the royal court. However, he would grow up to become the Israelite's leader, deliverer in to freedom and lawgiver."}]},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Timna","@type":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Person","http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/hasSiblings":[{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Zepho"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Amalek_biblicalFigures"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Kenaz_by_Eliphaz"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Teman"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Gatam"},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Omar"}],"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Timna"}},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/WorkHasFigures","@type":"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#SymmetricProperty","http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#domain":{"@id":"http://purl.org/vocab/frbr/core#Work"},"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#range":{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Person"},"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#inverseOf":{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/FiguresRelatedWithWork"}},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Loyalty","@type":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Subject","http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/relatedVerses":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"2 Chronicles 16:9 The Lord . . .

From each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders. So at the LORD'S command Moses sent them out from the Desert of Paran. All of them were leaders of the Israelites. These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur; from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi;  from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi;  from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.                                                                                                            These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the name Joshua.) When Moses sent them to explore Canaan, he said, \"Go up through the Negev and on into the hill country. See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many. What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What kind of towns do they live in? Are they unwalled or fortified? How is the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees on it or not? Do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land.\" (It was the season for the first ripe grapes.) So they went up and explored the land from the Desert of Zin as far as Rehob, toward Lebo Hamath. They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai and Talmai, the descendants of Anak, lived. (Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) When they reached the Valley of Eshcol, they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes. Two of them carried it on a pole between them, along with some pomegranates and figs. That place was called the Valley of Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the Israelites cut off there. At the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land.                                                                                                                                                    They came back to Moses and Aaron and the whole Israelite community at Kadesh in the Desert of Paran. There they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land. They gave Moses this account: \"We went into the land to which you sent us, and it does flow with milk and honey! Here is its fruit. But the people who live there are powerful, and the cities are fortified and very large. We even saw descendants of Anak there. The Amalekites live in the Negev; the Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan.\" Then Caleb silenced the people before Moses and said, \"We should go up and take possession of the land, for we can certainly do it.\" But the men who had gone up with him said, \"We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are.\" And they spread among the Israelites a bad report about the land they had explored. They said, \"The land we explored devours those living in it. All the people we saw there are of great size. We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim).

A General Favorite: Absalom was born at Hebron (2 Sam 3:3), and moved at an early age, with the transfer of the capital, to Jerusalem, where he spent most of his life. He was a great favorite of his father and of the people as well. His charming manners, his personal beauty, his insinuating ways, together with his love of pomp and royal pretensions, captivated the hearts of the people from the beginning. He lived in great style, drove in a magnificent chariot and had fifty men run before him. Such magnificence produced the desired effect upon the hearts of the young aristocrats of the royal city (2 Sam 15:1 ff). 2. In Exile: When Amnon, his half-brother, ravished his sister Tamar, and David shut his eyes to the grave crime and neglected to administer proper punishment, Absalom became justly enraged, and quietly nourished his anger, but after the lapse of two years carried out a successful plan to avenge his sister's wrongs. He made a great feast for the king's sons at Baalhazor, to which, among others, Amnon came, only to meet his death at the hands of Absalom's servants (2 Sam 13:1 ff). To avoid punishment he now fled to the court of his maternal grandfather in Geshur, where he remained three years, or until David, his father, had relented and condoned the murderous act of his impetuous, plotting son. At the end of three years (2 Sam 13:38) we find Absalom once more in Jerusalem.

Israel starts out as a nation of loosely affiliated tribes led by priests and religious heroes, but it becomes a nation-state led by a centralized king. Each stage of this transition is depicted through the narrative’s three main figures: Samuel represents the old rule of the judges, Saul represents Israel’s failed attempt at monarchy, and David represents God’s ideal king. Although it seems logical that the rule of a single king would bring a sense of unity and cohesiveness to Israel, the opposite is the case. The move away from religious leaders divides religious and political life in Israel. Confusion about how religion and politics ought to relate to one another is the chief source of conflict in Samuel. Indeed, Saul’s gravest mistake as king is his attempt to carry out the sacrificial duties of the priesthood—a role that Samuel explicitly denies the political ruler."},"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#sameAs":{"@id":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Books_of_Samuel"}},{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Hosea","@type":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Person","http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/figuresInBook":{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Book_of_Hosea"},"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/gender":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"male"},"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/hasParents":{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Beeri"},"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/hasRoles":{"@id":"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/Prophet"},"http://incheon.k-history.kr/resource/relatedVerses":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Hosea 1:2\r\n \r\nWhen the LORD first spoke through Hosea, the LORD said to Hosea, \"Go, take to yourself a wife of harlotry and have children of harlotry; for the land commits flagrant harlotry, forsaking the LORD.\" "},"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/description":{"@type":"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string","@value":"Hosea  was the son of Beeri and a prophet in Israel in the 8th century BC.

David sent his old friend Hushai back to Absalom, in order that he might counteract the counsel of Ahitophel (2 Sam. 15:31-37). Ahitophel, seeing that his good advice against David had not been followed due to Hushai's influence, correctly predicted that the revolt would fail. He then left the camp of Absalom at once. He returned to Giloh, his native place, and after arranging his worldly affairs, hanged himself, and was buried in the sepulcher of his fathers (2 Sam. 17:1-23). It would seem from a conjunction of II Sam, 23:34, and 11:3, that Ahitophel was the grandfather of Bathsheba, and it has been suggested, as an explanation of his conduct towards David, that he had kept a secret grudge against the King for the way he had treated Bathsheba, and her first husband, Urias.

they multiplied greatly, increased in numbers and became so numerous that the land was filled with them.\r\n\r\n8 Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. 9 “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. 10 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”\r\n\r\n11 So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. 12 But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread;

Jehoram, a descendant of King David, actively promoted the worship of YHWH in his country, but he tolerated Athaliah's worship of Baal. After Jehoram's death, their son Ahaziah became Judah's king with Athaliah acting as queen mother. She used her power in that role to establish the worship of Baal in Judah after Ahaziah was killed in a state visit to Israel along with the then-king of Israel, also named Jehoram, who was Athaliah's brother (or possibly nephew). Jehu assassinated them both in Yahweh's name and had Athaliah's entire extended family in Israel put to death.\r\nAthaliah, as queen of Judah, tried to have all possible successors to Ahaziah executed; one, however,a grandson of hers named Joash was rescued from the purge by Jehosheba, Ahaziah's sister, and was raised in secret by the priest Jehoiada. Six years later, Athaliah was surprised when Jehoiada revealed Joash and proclaimed him king of Judah.
